# Portal
When this script is attached to a zone, the zone serves as a portal, which can be used to transport avatars between domains and within domains.

## Setup
1. Rez a zone entity that you want to act as the portal.
2. Add the below `userData` object to the zone entity's `userData`.
3. Add the `portal.js` entity script to the zone entity.
4. Update `userData` at any time to modify the portal's destination.

Here's the object to add to the zone entity's `userData`:
```
{
    "destination": "<See the section titled 'The `destination` Key/Value Pair in `userData`' below.>"
}
```

### The `destination` Key/Value Pair in `userData`
The value associated with the `destination` key refers to the destination at which the portal user will appear.

The avatar's location will be changed using the `window.location` scripting interface, so relative paths and `hifi://` URLs are supported.

If you set the `destination` value using the syntax `bookmark:<bookmark name>`, then the portal will move the user to the location specified by that named bookmark (which is stored on the user's hard drive in `bookmarks.json`).
